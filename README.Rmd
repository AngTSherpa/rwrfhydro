# rwrfhydro
A community-contributed tool box for managing, analyzing, and visualizing WRF Hydro (and HydroDART) input and output files in R.

## Purpose
Purpose 
Intentionally, “rwrfhydro” can be read as “our wrf hydro”. The purpose of this R package is to focus community development of tools for working with and analyzing data related to the WRF Hydro model. These tools are both free and open-source, just like R, which should help make them accessible and popular. For users new to R, several introductory resources are listed below. 
The purpose of this README is to lay out the fundamental principles used in the development of the package so that contributors more efficiently fit their contributions into the package. 

## General guidelines for contributing to the rwrfhydro R package.
Several resources describing R package development are given below. Most of the guidlines listed below are adopted from [Hadley Wickham’s book on R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). And links used later point to the specific sections. 

### R package best practices and code style: ([http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html))

#### Organizing functions: ([http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#r-organising](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#r-organising))
* Do NOT put all functions in a single file, nor each in their own file. Functions should be grouped by files and may occasionally need moved to new or different files as new functions are written.
* File names end in .R and are all lowercase with _ used to separate words. (All lowercase (except the .R) helps ensure compatibility with Windows developers.)

#### R code style ([http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#style](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#style))
* Generally follow Google’s R style guide with preference for variableName (first-lower camel case) over variable.name (period distinction). Note that functions are first-upper camel case, e.g. FunctionName.  [https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)
* Variables are nouns. Functions are verbs.
* Lots of other style considerations to learn: indents, braces, line length, assignment, comment style.
